Experimental device tree with broken .flags & fstab's, TWRP-11 booting without issue.

Any pull request is welcome, but better do your own fork as this was done to help you trying to port twrp to this device.

The kernel got no sources as it is extracted from the device itself.

MTP not working, need fix.

Blue LED turn on while in twrp because of line for of init.recovery.mt6757.rc
